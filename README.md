# Unminable-Meteor
A port of LXYan2333's Fabric-Bedrock-Miner to Meteor addon.
His mod can be found at https://github.com/LXYan2333/Fabric-Bedrock-Miner

This port is an addon for Meteor client.
This version can also break any other normally unbreakable block!
However, I retricted nether portal blocks since even if the mod could break from the side, there is no way to suppress updates this quick.
